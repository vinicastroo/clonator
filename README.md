Clonator is a university project developed to understand and implement decision tree algorithms. This project aims to create a simple clone of the popular web-based game "Akinator," which guesses the character the player is thinking of by asking a series of questions.

## Features
- Interactive Questioning: The program asks a series of yes/no questions to guess the character.
- Decision Tree Implementation: Uses decision tree logic to navigate through the questions.
- Character Database: Includes a set of predefined characters and questions.
- Learning Capability: The program can learn new characters and questions based on user input, expanding its knowledge base over time.
